# Relic Rush
## Description
Relic Rush is a Minecraft minigame that runs on Bukkit/Spigot based servers
where the goal is to collect relics for points. There are 3 types of relics:
- Common
- Rare
- Golden

The common and rare relics are worth points. The team with the most points at
the end of the game wins. The golden relic is special in that it does not reward
points, but instead if a team holds it for a certain amount of time, they win automatically.

There are PvP elements in the game as well. Teams must attack each other to keep other teams
from holding the golden relic for too long. They must also fight the other teams to steal 
rare and common relics.

_Further gameplay features will be added as testing sessions are conducted._
